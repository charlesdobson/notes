## Notes

### Introduction

- Scaling a company is "crazy hard" and should be treated accordingly

### In the Eye of the Storm

- Early on, everyone in a company has many different jobs to do. Eventually, you need to start adding people to take over these tasks
- When "giving away your legos", it's best to just ignore the emotions of anxiety, distrust, insecurity, etc
- Managers should be explaining to direct reports that it's normal if they feel that way
- Explain why people are needed to build something else (help frame the size/goal of the opportunity)

### 30 to 50 Employees

- Communication starts to become a struggle around here
- Write down "who we are and how we do things" BEFORE you hit rapid growth and over-communicate this
- Answer questions like: What does a high performer at the company look like? What role does feedback play? What is the role of a manager at our company? How can someone fail here?

### 50 to 200 Employees

- Don't rush things. If you want your team to have certain values, stress them here.
- The single biggest indicator the predict the performance of a new hire is who they were referred by.

### 200 to 750 Employees

- Habits are now formed, you need to work on maintaining them as it grows rapidly.
- Any shift in culture at this point needs to be taken very deliberately

### Over 750 Employees

- This is where politics emerge, where people start to act in their own self interest rather than the best interest of the company.
- Strong, constant communication is the only way to keep things healthy

### Checklist

- [ ] Make a list of the qualities you want your company to embody. Who do you want to be? How do you want it to feel to work there?

- [ ] Write down what you’re doing in the world. What’s your vision for the change you want to make?

- [ ] Communicate these things again and again and again. Through all the channels. All the time. You can’t overcommunicate these ideas.

- [ ] Focus on hiring quality people rather than speed. Don’t lower your bar because you need to grow faster. It will come back to bite you.

- [ ] Fire people. Just do it!

- [ ] Hire amazing leaders as early as you can and help them grow their capabilities as the company grows.

- [ ] Prioritize principles over process.

- [ ] Keep giving away your Legos! And tell everyone around you to do the same. It’s going to be okay.
